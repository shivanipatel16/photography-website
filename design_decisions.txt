home + learning ui:
- need three tmeplates (learning, explore with one slider, explore with two sliders)
- on each html render, render appropriate text, image
- when we finish exploring each of the iso/aperture/shutter, go back to lesson page
- pressing "start" on home page resets to default state
- can quiz at any point
- cannot explore iso/aperture/shutter without learning first
    - for lessons with sliders, send down/store all relevant images in initial page render
    - pure js toggling between images with each discrete slider state
- persistent "quiz" button on the nav bar, conditional "quiz" button appears on the lesson page only if all "explore" sections visited

quiz ui:
 - only need one quiz_question_template.html page
 - on each html render, render appropriate text, image
 - store user state / quiz data on webserver
    - so that when user clicks "review," they can "return to quiz" (see slide 24/25 on ppt)
 - store user score (# correct / # total)
